		<div class="hd">What Does the Bank Deposit Form look like?</div>
		<div class="bd"><blockquote><p>To get all details for the form, please first make a Local Bank Deposit Request under 'Buying Credits' on the  <a href="http://www<?=$session_cookie_domain?>/merch/center.php" target="_blank">Merchant Center</a>.  Requesting bank details does not commit you to making a payment.  You can stop at any time.  If the Local Bank Deposit option does not appear, it may not be available in your <a href="http://blog<?=$session_cookie_domain?>/support/merchant-help/payment-method-by-country" target="_blank">country</a>. </p>
<p>The bank deposit form asks for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name (Please enter your name)</li>
<li>Payment Amount (Please enter how much you want to deposit)</li>
<li>migme's Bank Account Number (we will provide to you, please fill it in the bank deposit form)</li>
<li>Payment Reference Number (we will provide to you, please fill it in the bank deposit form).</li>

<li>Account Holder (This will be a Global Collect company.  They are migme's partner and they administer our Bank Deposit Process.)</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of a filled out Bank Deposit form can be viewed and printed.</p>
<p>If your bank deposit form looks different, please either ask the bank staff to help you, or scan a blank form and email it to us at <a href="mailto:merchant@<?=$imap_domain?>">merchant@<?=$imap_domain?></a>.  We will show you how to fill it in. </p>

		<div class="hd">How does Local Bank Deposit work?</div>
		<div class="bd">
<blockquote><p>Local Bank Deposit is also known as Local Direct Deposit, Bank Transfer, or Electronic Funds Transfer.</p>
<p>Global Collect, a migme partner, works with banks throughout the world to help migme collect money.  First you request a Payment Reference number and tell us you plan to make a deposit. Once you deposit your money at the bank and provide them the Payment Reference number, Global Collect tells migme the money has been collected.  We credit your migme user account and send you an SMS notification.<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><br /> </strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>

		<div class="hd">What if my account is not credited?</div>
		<div class="bd">
<blockquote><p>Don't worry! Sometimes this can happen if there was not enough information filled out on the Bank Deposit form.  Please keep your receipt as proof of payment.  Please email us your receipt number, name and amount to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:merchant@<?=$imap_domain?>">merchant@<?=$imap_domain?></a> if your account has not been credited after 5 days.</p>
<p>Please note that completing a Local Bank Deposit request online is not enough to get credits added to your migme username.  You must complete a deposit into the migme bank account we provide to you before we can add credits.<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><br /></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
